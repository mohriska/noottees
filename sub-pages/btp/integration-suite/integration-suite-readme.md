# Integration Suite


    Cloud Integration:
        Migration Tooling Improvements: A new migration pattern, Content-Based Routing pattern, is introduced. See Content-Based Routing.
        Manage Partner Directory Entries: You can now manage Partner Directory entries with the SAP Integration Suite user interface (under Monitor ïƒ  Integrations and APIs). You can use Partner Directory entries to parameterize integration flows.See Managing Partner Directory Entries .

    API Management: 
        The API business hub enterprise has been relaunched as Developer Hub with upgraded features. In addition to providing a central, managed, and curated catalog of APIs for developers, the Developer Hub now allows content administrators to discover APIs from various business systems and publish them as products in the catalog. These new features will enhance the experience for both developers and content administrators. See Manage Content.
    
    Integration Advisor:
        Global Code Value mappings can now be activated providing consistency and standardized code-value associations. See Global Code Value Mapping.
        Cloud Integration Flow Resources can now be directly injected into a Cloud Integration tenant (within the same Integration Suite subscription) without requiring manual destination configuration in your BTP subaccount.See Inject Mapping Artifacts to SAP Cloud Integration.
    
    Event Mesh: 
        Creating Webhook Subscriptions: You can now create webhook subscriptions to deliver messages from a queue to REST-based consumers. See Webhook Subscriptions and Create a Webhook Subscription.
