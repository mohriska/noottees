# Regular Expression Protection


[<- Back to APIM Security](./apim-security-regular-expr-protection.md)


As mentioned before, sometimes the threat to your security lies in the content you have to deal with. Regular expression protection helps you identify those threats.
 
Using the regular expression policy, you can extract information from messages and then use regular expressions on the content that are defined in the policy. If the expressions match, that is, come back true, a threat is to be expected.
