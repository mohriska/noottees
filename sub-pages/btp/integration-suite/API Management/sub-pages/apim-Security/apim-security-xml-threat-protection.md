# XML Threat Protection

[<- Back to APIM Security](./apim-security-readme.md)


This is another policy that allows you to reduce the threat through content-level attacks. XML threat protection allows you to minimize any risks posed by XML content by using the following approach:

* Validation: Validate against an XML schema.
* Evaluation: Look for keywords or patterns that are considered dangerous.
* Detection: Before a message gets parsed, detect corrupt or malformed messages.
