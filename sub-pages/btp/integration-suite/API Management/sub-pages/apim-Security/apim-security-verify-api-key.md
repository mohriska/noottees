# Verify API Key

[<- Back to APIM Security](./apim-security-readme.md)


You may know that the verify API key policy allows you to require an API key for the usage of your API. 

In SAP API Management, the API key is generated in the developer portal as soon as a developer subscribes to an associated product. 

In the verify API key policy, you can define where this API key needs to be stored so that itâ€™s considered (e.g., in the header information or a variable).
