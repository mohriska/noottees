# Security

[<- Back to API Management](../../sap-btp-api-management-readme.md)

SAP API Management already provides an additional security layer to your infrastructure. However, this isn’t where security stops when it comes to APIs.

In addition to out-of-the-box security in SAP API Management, it’s possible to implement security on an API proxy level. In other words, you can use security policies (see figure below) in your API proxy to implement API-specific security
