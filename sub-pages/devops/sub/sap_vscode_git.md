# VSCode Git Setup & Usage

## Workspaces
- workspaces are, ina nutshell, a project root folder but with extra VScode contextual information that allows youo to configur folder-specific settings, persist your debugger context and configuration, selectively enable/disable extensions and more ...

- VSCode treats any root folder as a workspace by default, but you'll have to explicitly save the workspace once you start adding workspace-specific configuration

- ToDo: check how to work with extensions

2. Create a Repository in GitHUb/GitLab
